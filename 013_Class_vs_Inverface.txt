When to Use Class and Interface?
Use a Class when:

Use a class when you need to represent a real-world entity with attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods).
Use a class when you need to create objects that hold state and perform actions
Classes are used for defining templates for objects with specific functionality and properties.
Use a Interface when:

Use an interface when you need to define a contract for behavior that multiple classes can implement.
Interface is ideal for achieving abstraction and multiple inheritance.
