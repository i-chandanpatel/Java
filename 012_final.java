// Final variables: Declaring a variable as final prevents its value from being changed after initialization, useful for constants.
// Final methods: When a method is declared as final, it cannot be overridden by a subclass. This is useful for methods that are part of a class's public API and should not be modified by subclasses.
// Final classes: When a class is declared as final, it cannot be extended by a subclass. This is useful for classes that are intended to be used as is and should not be modified or extended.
// Initialization: Final variables must be initialized either at the time of declaration or in the constructor of the class. This ensures that the value of the variable is set and cannot be changed.
// Performance: The use of a final can sometimes improve performance, as the compiler can optimize the code more effectively when it knows that a variable or method cannot be changed.
// Security: The final can help improve security by preventing malicious code from modifying sensitive data or behavior.
